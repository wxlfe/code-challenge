# Lifeway Code Challenge
To run this application, start the backend followed by the frontend. The application includes default users on initial 
start-up, but these can be deleted or modified like any other user. 

## Backend
Running the backend requires maven (I used version 3.8.4) and Java (I used version 17.0.1) to be installed. 
Within the lifeway-code-challenge directory, run `mvn spring-boot:run`, and the backend will start at 
(localhost:8080)[http://localhost:8080].

## Frontend
### Using Yarn
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. Run `yarn start` to start the standard dev server at (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000].

### Using NPM
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the standard dev server at (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000].
